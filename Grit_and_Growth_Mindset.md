# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Grit: What is it?
Grit is the ability to persevere in the face of difficulty. Even if results take time, it's about persevering and working consistently.

## A growth mindset: what is it?
Having a growth mindset is the conviction that daily practice and learning will lead to improvement. I say, "I'll get better with time," rather than, "I can't do this."

## Internal locus of control: what is it?
It indicates that I think my actions are primarily responsible for the events in my life. I try harder and continue to learn because I feel in control.

## Advice for Developing a Growth Mindset:
Consider challenges as opportunities for personal development; learn from errors rather than feeling guilty; practice daily; pay attention to and act upon criticism; and persevere, despite difficulties.

## My Easy Strategy to Develop a Growth Mindset:
* I'll remind myself that everyone makes mistakes
* I'll persevere even when I want to give up
* I'll seek advice from friends or teachers to gain more knowledge
* I'll be pleased when I achieve even modest progress.
