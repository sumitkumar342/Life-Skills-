# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment occurs when unwanted sexual comments, gestures, messages or touch that make another person feel uncomfortable or insecure.
It can be oral, physical or online, and the key is that the behavior is undesirable.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would stay calm, clearly say it is unwanted, and document the incident. Then I would report it to the appropriate authority.
